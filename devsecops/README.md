# DevSecOps Configuration

This section of the repository provides configuration templates and workflows to integrate security into your DevOps pipeline. By incorporating security checks early and often, you can ensure secure software development practices.

## Tools Included

1. **[Pip-Audit](./pip-audit/README.md)**: A tool for auditing Python dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
2. Additional tools and configurations will be added in the future.

## Usage

Each tool has its own directory with configuration files, workflows, and supporting documentation to help you integrate them into your CI/CD pipeline.
